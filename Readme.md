 **1.Implementation of Even Parity Generator Using Dynamic CMOS(NORA)Logic**

 Steps Required To implement an even parity generator using dynamic CMOS (NORA) logic using dsch and Microwind software:

1. Design the circuit using dsch software:
   - Launch the dsch software and create a new project.
   - Select the desired components from the component library, such as NMOS and PMOS transistors.
   - Place the components on the design canvas and connect them according to the even parity generator logic.
   - Ensure that the inputs and outputs are correctly labeled.

2. Simulate the circuit using dsch software:
   - Set the input values for the parity generator circuit based on the desired even parity behavior.
   - Run the simulation in dsch to verify the functionality of the circuit.
   - Check if the output matches the expected even parity result.

3. Generate the layout using Microwind software:
   - Export the circuit design from dsch software in a compatible format (such as SPICE netlist).
   - Open Microwind software and create a new layout project.
   - Import the circuit design into Microwind using the imported SPICE netlist.
   - Define the technology parameters and process settings for the CMOS fabrication process.

4. Layout the circuit using Microwind software:
   - Place the transistors and other components on the layout canvas according to the design specifications.
   - Connect the components using appropriate metal and diffusion layers.
   - Follow the design rules and guidelines for the CMOS process to ensure manufacturability.
   - Optimize the layout for area, power, and performance as required.

5. Verify the layout using Microwind software:
   - Run the design rule check (DRC) to ensure that the layout adheres to the CMOS fabrication process rules.
   - Perform layout versus schematic (LVS) verification to check if the layout matches the original circuit design.

6. Generate the mask layout using Microwind software:
   - Once the layout is verified, generate the mask layout files required for CMOS fabrication.
   - These files typically include GDSII, CIF, and layer-specific mask data files.

7. Fabrication and testing:
   - Send the mask layout files to a fabrication facility for the production of the CMOS integrated circuit.
   - Once the chips are fabricated, perform testing to verify their functionality and performance.

It's important to note that dsch and Microwind are software tools commonly used for circuit design and layout in the educational and research domains. However, there might be other software tools available in the market that provide similar functionalities. Additionally, the specific steps and procedures may vary depending on the version and configuration of the software tools being used.
