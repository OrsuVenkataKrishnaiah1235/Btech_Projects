##**Implementation of temperature based 12vDc Fan Speed Controller using Arduino Microcontroller**

To implement a temperature-based 12V DC fan speed controller using an Arduino microcontroller, you can follow these steps:

1. Hardware Setup:
   - Connect the Arduino board to your computer via USB.
   - Connect a temperature sensor (e.g., LM35 or DHT11) to the Arduino board to measure the temperature.
   - Connect a 12V DC fan to the Arduino board via a transistor or a motor driver module to control its speed.
   - Ensure proper power supply for both the Arduino board and the fan.

2. Arduino Programming:
   - Install the Arduino IDE software on your computer if you haven't already.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Initialize the necessary libraries for the temperature sensor (if required).
   - Set up the pin modes for the temperature sensor input and the fan speed control output.
   - Write the main code logic:
     - Read the temperature value from the sensor.
     - Define thresholds for different temperature ranges and corresponding fan speeds.
     - Map the temperature value to the desired fan speed within the defined thresholds.
     - Set the fan speed output accordingly using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).
   - Upload the code to the Arduino board.

3. Testing and Calibration:
   - Connect the power supply to the Arduino board.
   - Place the temperature sensor in the desired location to measure the ambient temperature.
   - Observe the fan speed changes based on the temperature readings.
   - Fine-tune the temperature thresholds and fan speed mappings if necessary to achieve the desired control behavior.
   - Test the system under different temperature conditions to ensure it functions as expected.

Note: The specific code implementation may vary depending on the chosen temperature sensor, fan control method, and Arduino board model. It's important to refer to the documentation and example codes provided by the sensor and fan module manufacturers, as well as the Arduino board's specifications and pin assignments.

Also, ensure proper electrical safety precautions, such as using appropriate voltage levels, correctly interfacing the fan with the Arduino, and avoiding short circuits or excessive current draw.
